The State is an illegitimate organization based on violence and theft that has convinced otherwise free people that it’s existence is not only benevolent, but necessary in maintaining a prosperous, peaceful, and free society. I’m here to tell you, that’s a lie. So long as there is a State, there will be no prosperity. So long as there is a State, there will be no peace. So long as there is a State, there will be no freedom. So, let’s break it! New episodes every other Tuesday. <a href="https://anchor.fm/breakthestate/support">Support this podcast.</a><br>
